# 6-Weather-Dashboard-App

Weather App to display the current weather in given city.

Created Weather Dashboard so I can view the weather in any given city (provided that city is in the dataset) with the click of a button. When I search for a city it creates a button that I can use to access that city's data again when I click that button again.\*
\*(I was unable to figure out how to recall the data. I tried refactoring some of my code —see alternate.js— to pull button functions out of the click events but couldn't figure out what to then ).

I utilized the API data from OpenWeather.org.
